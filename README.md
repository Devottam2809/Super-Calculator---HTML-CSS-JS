# This calculator is designed using HTML, CSS, and JS means that the calculator was built using three different web development technologies: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and JavaScript (JS).

# HTML is used to structure the content of the calculator, defining the various elements and their relationships with each other. It allows the developer to create different types of input fields and buttons that the user can interact with.

# CSS is used to style the visual appearance of the calculator, such as setting the font, color, and layout of the different elements. It allows the developer to create an attractive and user-friendly interface.

# JavaScript is used to add functionality to the calculator, such as performing arithmetic calculations based on the user's input. It allows the developer to create dynamic and interactive elements on the webpage, enabling the user to perform different operations with ease.

# The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also supports decimal calculations, allowing the user to enter and calculate numbers with decimal points.

# Overall, the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows for the creation of a fully-functional calculator that can perform a wide range of arithmetic operations and provide a user-friendly interface for the user.
